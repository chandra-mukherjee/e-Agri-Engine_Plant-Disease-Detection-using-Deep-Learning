# e-Agri Engine :Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning


* Developed a full- stack deep learning-based solution to detect plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) built in PyTorch.
* Utilized a dataset of 61,486 images across 35 plant species, employing data augmentation techniques (flipping, gamma correction, PCA, rotation, noise, scaling) to improve model generalization.
* Engineered a custom CNN architecture with manual convolution arithmetic, achieving 83% test accuracy after training with CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.
* Built a responsive Flask web application to serve the trained model and enable real-time disease detection for agricultural users.
* Implemented a complete ML pipeline including train-validation-test split, batch gradient descent, and performance evaluation using accuracy metrics.
* Optimized model performance using Batch Normalization, ReLU, MaxPooling, and fully connected layers.
* Designed the solution with scalability in mind for potential deployment in real-world agri-tech environments.
