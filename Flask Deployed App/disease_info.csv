6,Cherry : Powdery Mildew,"Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation, are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to infection than younger leaves. Look for early leaf infections on root suckers, the interior of the canopy or the crotch of the tree where humidity is high. In contrast to other fungi, powdery mildews do not need free water to germinate but germination and fungal growth are favored by high humidity. The disease is more likely to initiate on the undersides (abaxial) of leaves but will occur on both sides at later stages. As the season progresses and infection is spread by wind, leaves may become distorted, curling upward. Severe infections may cause leaves to pucker and twist. Newly developed leaves on new shoots become progressively smaller, are often pale and may be distorted.","Disinfect the cutting edges, then prune out and discard the diseased portions of the plant immediately. At the same time, apply fungicides to protect the remaining leaves on the fruit tree. You'll need to repeat the fungicide applications according to label instructions to protect the trees over the entire season.",http://treefruit.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fig1.png

19,Pepper bell : Bacterial Spot,"Leaf spots that appear on the lower surface of older leaves as small, pimples and on the upper leaf surface as small water-soaked spots are a symptom of bacterial spot. This is an important pepper disease in Maryland. It also occasionally attacks tomatoes. Eventually, the spots develop gray to tan centers with darker borders. Lesions enlarge during warm, humid weather. Leaves may then turn yellow, then brown and drop. Lesions may also develop on stems. Fruits develop small, raised rough spots that do not affect eating quality. Severely infected leaves will drop resulting in sunscald of peppers. Bacterial leaf spot is spread by splashing rain and working with wet, infected plants. This disease can defoliate plants during wet weather. Hot, dry weather slows the spread of this disease. The disease can come in on seed or transplants and can overwinter in crop residue and soil.","Select resistant varieties

Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting.
Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings.
Avoid overhead watering.
Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season.

20,Pepper bell : Healthy,"Keep bell peppers well-watered, but never leave soil soggy. Water to moisten soil about 6 inches deep, then let it dry slightly. Watering is especially important during fruit set, when tiny peppers take the place of blossoms, and as the bells mature. Consistent moisture helps keep peppers firm and healthy.","Red, Orange, and Yellow Bell Peppers are full of great health benefits�they're packed with vitamins and low in calories!

21,Potato : Early Blight,"In most production areas, early blight occurs annually to some degree. The severity of early blight is dependent upon the frequency of foliar wetness from rain, dew, or irrigation; the nutritional status of the foliage; and cultivar susceptibility.The first symptoms of early blight appear as small, circular or irregular, dark-brown to black spots on the older (lower) leaves. These spots enlarge up to 3/8 inch in diameter and gradually may become angular-shaped.Initial lesions on young, fully expanded leaves may be confused with brown spot lesions. These first lesions appear about two to three days after infection, with further sporulation on the surface of these lesions occurring three to five days later.",Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible.,https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/publications/crops/early-blight-in-potato/figure-1-opt.jpeg/@@images/468990cc-77a9-4e29-8779-0eb3e94e0407.jpeg
22,Potato : Late Blight,"The primary host is potato, but P. infestans also can infect other solanaceous plants, including tomatoes, petunias and hairy nightshade, that can act as source of inoculum to potato.The first symptoms of late blight in the field are small, light to dark green, circular to irregular-shaped water-soaked spots. These lesions usually appear first on the lower leaves. Lesions often begin to develop near the leaf tips or edges, where dew is retained the longest.During cool, moist weather, these lesions expand rapidly into large, dark brown or black lesions, often appearing greasy. Leaf lesions also frequently are surrounded by a yellow chlorotic halo",The severe late blight can be effectively managed with prophylactic spray of mancozeb at 0.25% followed by cymoxanil+mancozeb or dimethomorph+mancozeb at 0.3% at the onset of disease and one more spray of mancozeb at 0.25% seven days after application of systemic fungicides in West Bengal ,https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/publications/crops/late-blight-in-potato/figure-2-opt.jpeg/@@images/dfe1e0b4-08d4-404a-8e66-474de72b1e91.jpeg
23,Potato : Healthy,"Many potatoes need consistent moisture levels to develop, so water regularly on a daily basis when tubers establish. When you the water the potato plants it should reach to the ground level of about 8-10 inches. During hot or warm seasons water the potato plants in huge amounts twice a day as the soil gets dry quickly.","Packed With Nutrients. Share on Pinterest.

26,Squash : Powdery Mildew,"White powdery spots can form on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and quickly expand into large blotches.
Powdery mildew weakens the plant and the fruit ripens prematurely. Fewer and smaller fruit grow on infected plants.
In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease.
Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer in Minnesota.
Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.
If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.","Combine one tablespoon baking soda and one-half teaspoon of liquid, non-detergent soap with one gallon of water, and spray the mixture liberally on the plants. Mouthwash. The mouthwash you may use on a daily basis for killing the germs in your mouth can also be effective at killing powdery mildew spores.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/caption_medium/public/powdery-mildew-2.jpg?itok=Un68av52
27,Strawberry : Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch symptoms are very similar to the early stages of common (Mycosphaerella) leaf spot, with irregular dark purple spots being scattered over the upper leaf surface. As the spots enlarge, they begin to look like drops of tar, and are actually the accumulations of black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus. The centers of the spots remain purple (in Mycosphaerella leaf spot they are white) and there is no well-defined lesion border. In heavy infections, these regions coalesce and the tissue between the lesions often takes on a purplish to bright red color that is dependent on cultivar, temperature, or other factors. The leaves eventually turn brown, dry up, and curl at the margins giving the leaf a scorched appearance. Examination of the acervuli and conidial morphology can help to distinguish between leaf spot and leaf scorch at this advanced stage of disease. On the upper leaf surfaces of leaf scorch lesions, the acervuli are dark with glistening spore masses and dark apothecia. Petiole lesions are elongate, sunken, with a purplish to brown color and can kill the leaf by girdling the petiole. Runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps can also become infected. Plants may become weakened and the number and vigor of crowns reduced. Infection predisposes the plants to winter and drought stress. In severe infestations, flowers and fruit may die.","While leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention. Since this fungal pathogen overwinters on the fallen leaves of infected plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.",https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/media/images/17531_IMG_2126.JPG
28,Strawberry : Healthy,"Find them a sunny spot because they love and need lots of light. I prefer a spot where they receive the morning sun.
If you have them in pots and/or other containers, it is good to move them during the day to take advantage of changing sunlight.
They are thirsty plants. Water them daily, especially if they are producing fruit. It is best to do it in the morning and to avoid wetting the leaves for disease prevention.
Keep them guarded from extreme weather conditions and wind. Please note that even if they like sunlight, being exposed to direct midday sunlight can be damaging as well.
Check the pots for good drainage.
Keep weeds and unwanted plants in check.
You need to fertilize them because they need a lot of energy to produce strawberries. Buy a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10, 12-12-12, etc). Follow the directions because too much fertilizer can reduce the fruit yield and it may also stimulate runner production.","The heart-shaped silhouette of the strawberry is the first clue that this fruit is good for you. These potent little packages protect your heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and guard against cancer.

29,Tomato : Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial spot of tomato is a potentially devastating disease that, in severe cases, can lead to unmarketable fruit and even plant death.  Bacterial spot can occur wherever tomatoes are grown, but is found most frequently in warm, wet climates, as well as in greenhouses.  The disease is often an issue in Wisconsin.Bacterial spot can affect all above ground parts of a tomato plant, including the leaves, stems, and fruit.  Bacterial spot appears on leaves as small (less than ? inch), sometimes water-soaked (i.e., wet-looking) circular areas.  Spots may initially be yellow-green, but darken to brownish-red as they age.  When the disease is severe, extensive leaf yellowing and leaf loss can also occur.  On green fruit, spots are typically small, raised and blister-like, and may have a yellowish halo.  As fruit mature, the spots enlarge (reaching a maximum size of � inch) and turn brown, scabby and rough.  Mature spots may be raised, or sunken with raised edges.","Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122�F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.  To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.  Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.  Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the product that you select to ensure that you use it in the safest and most effective manner possible.",https://www.growingproduce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bacterial_spot_tomato.jpg
30,Tomato : Early Blight,"Early blight is one of the most common tomato diseases, occurring nearly every season wherever tomatoes are grown.
It affects leaves, fruits and stems and can be severely yield limiting when susceptible cultivars are used and weather is favorable.
Severe defoliation can occur and result in sunscald on the fruit.
Early blight is common in both field and high tunnel tomato production in Minnesota.","Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.
Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.
Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.
For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.
Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide� Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/large/public/early-blight-leaf-tomato.jpg?itok=woYQQlrF
31,Tomato : Late Blight,"Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.
There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato and potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of tomato plants.
The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.
Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.","Sanitation is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit. Currently, there are no strains of tomato available that are resistant to late tomato blight, so plants should be inspected at least twice a week. Since late blight symptoms are more likely to occur during wet conditions, more care should be taken during those times. For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.","https://www.canr.msu.edu/contentAsset/image/e97d1ef0-5b55-49b0-ab4e-c57dcbeca65e/fileAsset/filter/Resize,Jpeg/resize_w/750/jpeg_q/80"
32,Tomato : Leaf Mold,"Tomato leaf mold is a fungal disease that can develop when there are extended periods of leaf wetness and the relative humidity is high (greater than 85 percent). Due to this moisture requirement, the disease is seen primarily in hoophouses and greenhouses. Tomato leaf mold can develop during early spring temperatures (50.9 degrees Fahrenheit) or those characteristic of summer (90 F). The optimal temperature tomato leaf mold is in the low 70s.

Symptoms of disease include yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Discrete masses of olive-green spores can be seen on the underside of the affected leaves.","When treating tomato plants with fungicide, be sure to cover all areas of the plant that are above the soil, especially the underside of leaves, where the disease often forms. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available.",https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tomato-leaf-mold-400x300.jpg
33,Tomato : Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.","Remove diseased leaves. 
Improve air circulation around the plants.
Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.
Do not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.
Control weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.
Use crop rotation. Next year do not plant tomatoes back in the same location where diseased tomatoes grew. Wait 1�2 years before replanting tomatoes in these areas.
Use fungicidal sprays.",https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/portals/0/Gardening/Gardening%20Help/images/Pests/Septoria_Leaf_Spot_of_Tomato187.jpg
34,Tomato : Spider Mites | Two-Spotted Spider Mite,"The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England. Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.","Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.
Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
Do not over-fertilize.
Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.",https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/310a.jpg?itok=XNlP0H9H
35,Tomato : Target Spot,"The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin . Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of ""target spot"" . Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid , causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die . Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.
The spores are spread by wind-blown rain, and if windy wet weather continues for a few days, spread is fast and plants lose their leaves quickly.","Cultural control is important. The following should be done:
Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.
Plant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).
Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.
Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.
Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.
Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.",https://barmac.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/01/Target-Spot-Tomato1.jpg
36,Tomato : Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is a species in the genus Begomovirus and family Geminiviridae. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) infection induces severe symptoms on tomato plants and causes serious yield losses worldwide. TYLCV is persistently transmitted by the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). Cultivars and hybrids with a single or few genes conferring resistance against TYLCV are often planted to mitigate TYLCV-induced losses. These resistant genotypes (cultivars or hybrids) are not immune to TYLCV. They typically develop systemic infection, display mild symptoms, and produce more marketable tomatoes than susceptible genotypes under TYLCV pressure.In several pathosystems, extensive use of resistant cultivars with single dominant resistance-conferring gene has led to intense selection pressure on the virus, development of highly virulent strains, and resistance breakdown.",Use only virus-and whitefly-free tomato and pepper transplants. Transplants should be treated with Capture (bifenthrin) or Venom (dinotefuran) for whitefly adults and Oberon for eggs and nymphs. Imidacloprid or thiamethoxam should be used in transplant houses at least seven days before shipping. Imidacloprid should be sprayed on the entire plant and below the leaves; eggs and flies are often found below the leaves. Spray every 14-21 days and rotate on a monthly basis with Abamectin so that the whiteflies do not build-up resistance to chemicals.,https://gd.eppo.int/media/data/taxon/T/TYLCV0/pics/1024x0/10609.jpg
37,Tomato : Mosaic Virus,"Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and  Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are hard to distinguish.
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) can cause yellowing and stunting of tomato plants resulting in loss of stand and reduced yield.
ToMV may cause uneven ripening of fruit, further reducing yield.
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was once thought to be more common on tomato. 
TMV is usually more of a tobacco pathogen than a tomato pathogen.Mottled light and dark green on leaves.

Soak seeds in a 10% solution of trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) for at least 15 minutes.
Or heat dry seeds to 158 �F and hold them at that temperature for two to four days.
Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.
Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.
Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
